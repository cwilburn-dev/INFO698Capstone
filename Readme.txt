11am-3pm: made the decision to attempt this without a proper database; will try streamlit instead, as I have had some success with it on another project.  if it doesn't work out, some form of lightweight relational database will be implemented.  wrote pre-processing and basic analysis code, but was running into issues with ArrivalDate.  this required fixing some of the data in the csv file, as somehow, the export changed the cell type on some of the dates, resulting in some data being dumped at processing time.

10am-12pm: evaluated preliminary data for contingency plan and very small samples from several ancestry.com sources, assessed project in current state and viability of proposed project, and decided on reducing scope to 1880 to 1914 to focus on the peak years. due to ellis island and castle garden records availability, they will be primary data source.  most robust and complete of the ones available.  have also expanded the search to include all passengers who departed to the US via the UK.  this will allow for better comparison of rates of emigration by ethnicity/nationality.  also decided to use 5 year bins for the data, with 20 records per bin.  this gives me 7 bins total for the new year range.  wrote a small python script to randomly assign a letter of last name to assist with random sampling.

4pm-3:30am: initial 140 records entered from ancestry.com into csv; compiled project logs from notes; really should do this immediately after my work, not later from my notes.

1pm-1:30pm: Meeting with Prof. Werchan via Zoom; discussed contingency plan to include some data from secondary sources if necessary.  was given the go ahead to continue trying to get viable primary data manually.  unsure of time investment required, but i would have preferred an API.
8pm-12am: explored ancestry.com immigration and emigration collections.  i'm a bit overwhelmed by the volume of records to go through, even though i know many will not be relevant to my project.  its still a daunting task.  collected a few sample records from 4 collections for evaluation sometime over the next few days.

10am-10:30am: Meeting with Prof. Werchan via Zoom; discussed contact follow-ups with familysearch.org and ancestry.com and their lack of available datasets or API access and how this may affect the project.

General: received response from ancestry.com, no api access but there is a student discount available.  also can't scrape data, all searches must be manually conducted.  bummer.
12pm-3pm: Re-read relevant chapters of Nugent's Crossings for better context in relation to the UK during the period.

10/17/25 (5 hours)
10am-1pm: Explored ancestry.com and familysearch.org to evaluate the types of records available, what kinds of search tools they provide, what types of access are available (free, memberships, discounts, api).  emailed them to inquire about api access, etc.
4pm-6pm: continued searching the websites

10am-10:30am: Meeting with Prof. Werchan via Zoom; discussed preliminary searches and strategy.  talked about some potential difficulties, like data access. i know i'm behind at this point, but can make it up with some free time.  i told him that i know i'm behind too.  shouldn't be a problem though now that I've wrapped up that one class and have the other project in a good place.

No meeting this week with Prof. Werchan; touched base via email.  same as last week, he knows that i'm busy with other projects but will make time when i can.

10/2/25 (10 min)
No meeting this week with Prof. Werchan; touched base via email.  in addition to my usual weekly course work, i have a project proposal for another class and a final project for a 7 week course that are due by the 15th of October.  Unfortunately, that will heavily restrict my time to work on this project until those are under control/completed.
