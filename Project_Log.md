## Week 16 (Dec 4 - Dec 10)

### 12/07/25 (15.5 hours)
- 11am-4pm: Completed supporting paper for the project; will review it in the morning.
- 6pm-9:30pm: Cleaned up codebase and Readme; added headers, added docstrings, and removed debugging code.  Cleaned up a few spelling and verbiage issues.
- 10:30pm-5:30am: Added a new dataset bringing total records to 588, but the app is refusing to add the new records.

### 12/06/25 (9 hours)
- 10am-1pm: Revised résumé and LinkedIn to reflect master's degree and a couple of projects (this is one of them).
- 7pm-1am: Revised supporting paper; was in pretty good shape with the draft, but needed a consistency check between the paper and the code.

## Week 15 (Nov 27 - Dec 3)

### 12/03/25 (8 hours)
- 6pm-9:30pm: Completed the poster.  Unsure if I needed that, as I'm not able to attend or present at the iShowcase, but felt that it was better safe than sorry.
- 9:30pm-2am: Updated the Readme.md to accurately reflect the current state of the project and converted my project_log.txt to Project_Log.md.

### 11/28/25 (3 hours)
- 12pm-3pm: Fighting with the Streamlit deployment.  Woke up today and it now had errors that were not previously there.  It's always something.

## Week 14 (Nov 21 - Nov 27)

### 11/27/25 (12 hours)
- 10am-2:30pm: Finally resolved a display issue in my timeline; that one had been bothering me for a couple of weeks and after several attempts to locate the source, it's finally fixed.  
- 7pm-10pm: Additional work on writing descriptions.  
- 12am-2:30am: Continued writing and revising analysis for app. Almost done at this point with a first pass through all sections. Will need to review and revise again once first pass is done.

### 11/26/25 (11 hours)
- 10:30am-5pm: Worked on analysis descriptions and cleaned up some display issues with the Streamlit app. Began cleaning up the code and removing unnecessary parts to start preparing for project submission.  
- 8:00pm-10:30pm: Additional revision of analysis across all sections.  
- 12am-2am: Attempted to resolve issue with timeline row ordering, only partially resolved; will have to try again tomorrow.

### 11/25/25 (9 hours)
- 10am-2:30pm: Completed JSON historical events. Will refine timeline display this afternoon.  
- 6pm-10pm: Enhanced Temporal Trends graph with markers.  
- 12am-1:30am: Added markers for individual countries to Temporal graph.

### 11/24/25 (3.5 hours)
- 10am-10:30am: Meeting with Prof. Werchan via Zoom; this was a last chance to ask questions before Thanksgiving meeting.  Spoke briefly of project status but everything was pretty much in the same state from last time; no new questions for him at this time.  
- 1pm-4pm: Wrote descriptions for temporal (complete) and clustering (in progress).

### 11/22/25 (3.5 hours)
- 10:30am-2pm: Continued work on Streamlit page; it's actually starting to come together. Still have a lot more work to do.

### 11/21/25 (2.5 hours)
- 12pm-2:30pm: Rewrote README.md, updated project logs, cleaned up GitHub repository.

## Week 13 (Nov 14 - Nov 20)

### 11/20/25 (0.5 hours)
- 10am-10:30am: Meeting with Prof. Werchan via Zoom; would still like to add more data, but it's the lowest priority. At this point, anything that is incomplete must be finished. This means analysis descriptions, short paper, documentation, deployment, and I feel like I'm missing one more component.

### 11/18/25 (3.5 hours)
- 10:30am-2pm: Fixed the coverage error from yesterday, added 28 new records for a total of 448. Made sure that it integrated with the original data.

### 11/17/25 (3.5 hours)
- 12am-3:30am: Discovered coverage error in data; Jewish people were not specifically tracked in immigration records until 1903-1909, after which point they are not specifically tracked again. Tomorrow I will have to correct the dataset with a proportional update.
